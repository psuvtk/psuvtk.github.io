## Entry的不同类型
```c
/*
 * The bottom two bits of the entry determine how the XArray interprets
 * the contents:
 *
 * 00: Pointer entry
 * 10: Internal entry
 * x1: Value entry or tagged pointer
 *
 * Attempting to store internal entries in the XArray is a bug.
 *
 * Most internal entries are pointers to the next node in the tree.
 * The following internal entries have a special meaning:
 *
 * 0-62: Sibling entries
 * 256: Retry entry
 * 257: Zero entry
 *
 * Errors are also represented as internal entries, but use the negative
 * space (-4094 to -2).  They're never stored in the slots array; only
 * returned by the normal API.
